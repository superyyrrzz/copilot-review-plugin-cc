  Use when user says "local copilot review", "copilot cli review", "ask copilot to review locally",

  This is for the npm-installed Copilot CLI — NOT the online GitHub Copilot PR reviewer.

# Local Copilot CLI Review Loop

Iterative loop: run ACP-based review → fix findings → re-run → repeat until clean.

## Running the CLI

Use the ACP companion script for structured, session-based reviews. Replace `<SKILL_BASE_DIR>` with the "Base directory for this skill" path shown above when this skill is loaded:

```bash
node "<SKILL_BASE_DIR>/scripts/copilot-acp-companion.mjs" review --base <base_ref>
```

**Options:**
- `--base <ref>` — Git base ref for diff (e.g., `main`, `origin/main`). Omit for working-tree changes.
- `--cwd <path>` — Working directory (default: current directory)
- `--json` — Output structured JSON: `{ review, stopReason, base, exitCode }`
- `--timeout <ms>` — Max wall-clock timeout in ms (default: 1800000 = 30 min)
- `--idle-timeout <ms>` — Cancel if no activity for this long, in ms (default: 120000 = 2 min)
- Positional args after flags are treated as additional focus text

**Examples:**
```bash
# Review changes against main branch
node "<SKILL_BASE_DIR>/scripts/copilot-acp-companion.mjs" review --base main

# Review staged and unstaged changes vs HEAD (untracked files are not included)
node "<SKILL_BASE_DIR>/scripts/copilot-acp-companion.mjs" review

# JSON output with focus
node "<SKILL_BASE_DIR>/scripts/copilot-acp-companion.mjs" review --base main --json "focus on error handling"
```

- The companion script manages the ACP lifecycle internally (connect, session, prompt, cleanup)
- Set `COPILOT_ACP_ALLOW_ALL_TOOLS=1` to pass `--allow-all-tools` to Copilot CLI, broadening tool-execution permissions. Only enable in trusted, controlled environments.
- Uses activity-based idle timeout (default 2 min) — as long as Copilot is actively working (thinking, reading files, running tools), the session continues. A 30-minute wall-clock safety valve prevents runaway sessions.
- Findings are reported as `[file:line] severity (high/medium/low): description`

## Workflow

**IMPORTANT: This is a MANDATORY loop. You MUST keep iterating until a stop condition is met. Do NOT stop after a single iteration just because you fixed or dismissed some findings.**

1. **Detect scope**: Determine `--base` ref. For PRs use the PR base branch. For local work use `main` or `origin/main`. Note: `--base` performs a commit-to-commit diff (`base...HEAD`), so staged/unstaged working-tree changes are NOT included — commit first, or omit `--base` to diff against HEAD including working-tree changes.
2. **Run the companion script** with appropriate `--base` flag
3. **Process ALL findings from this iteration**:
   - Read the referenced code at the cited line numbers to verify each finding
   - Fix findings that are valid
   - Dismiss findings that are invalid (note why briefly)
   - Track counts of fixed vs dismissed, and maintain a list of dismissed findings (file, line range, issue summary) for loop detection
4. **If code was changed**: build and test. If build/test fails, stop and surface the error.
5. **If code was changed**: commit the fixes (do NOT push unless user asked)
6. **Re-run the companion script** — this is a NEW ACP session that sees the updated code
7. **Repeat from step 3** until a stop condition is met

### Stop conditions

- CLI output contains no `[file:line]` findings (only praise, "looks good", "No issues found.", or "No changes found to review.")
- ALL findings in the current iteration were already seen AND dismissed in a PREVIOUS iteration of THIS loop (loop detection). "Previous conversation" findings do NOT count — only findings from this invocation.
- 5 iterations reached (safety valve — surface remaining findings to user)
- Build/test fails after a fix (stop, surface error, let user decide)
- CLI times out (report it, suggest retrying)

### What counts as "same finding" for loop detection

Two findings are the same if they reference the same file, similar line range (±10 lines), and describe the same core issue. Cosmetic wording differences don't matter. If the finding is about code you just changed, it's NOT a repeat — re-assess it.

## Output format

After the loop ends, report:

```
Local Copilot CLI review complete.
- Iterations: N
- Findings fixed: X
- Findings dismissed (invalid): Y
- Remaining: Z (if any)
```
